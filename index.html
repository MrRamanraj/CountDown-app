            <!-- <p>Education provides stability in life, and it's something that no one can ever take away from you. By
                being well-educated and holding a college degree, you increase your chances for better career
                opportunities and open up new doors for yourself.
                Education helps a person to get knowledge and improve confidence in life. It can help you improve in
                your career and your personal growth. An educated person can become a great citizen in society. It helps
                you to take the right decisions in life.

                The modern, developed and industrialised world is running on the wheels of education. To be able to
                survive in the competitive world, we all need education as a torch that leads the way. Mentioned below
                are the various features of education which outline the importance of education in human life:

                Safety Against Crime: The chances of an educated person getting involved in crime or criminal acts are
                very low. An educated person is well aware of his/ her surroundings and is less susceptible to getting
                cheated or be fooled.
                Women Empowerment: The empowerment of women is an essential and important pillar to optimize the good
                functioning of our society and nation as a whole. We can break old customs like child marriage, sati,
                dowry, etc only by educating the men and women of our nation. The fundamental right of Right to Freedom
                and Expression can only be achieved if the women of our country are educated and empowered. We can win
                the fight against the many social evils.
                Removing Poverty: Education is pivotal in removing our poverty from our society and our country. The
                clutches of poverty are very harsh and one of the main factors behind all the problems of our society.
                If a person if well educated, he/she can get a good job and earn money to sustain his/ her family.
                Preventing War and Terrorism: Education teaches everyone the importance of peace and brotherhood. The
                importance of staying united and spreading love is the need of the hour. To achieve world peace and
                prevent war and terrorism, education is important.
                Maintaining Law and Order: A good political ideology can only be developed if the citizens of our
                country are educated and taught the importance of following and respecting the law and order of our
                country. Law-abiding citizens contribute majorly in improving and sustaining the law and order of the
                country and the world.</p> -->

                    <p class="para-Big">History</p>
                    <p class="para-small"> Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge
                        and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                        orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
                        generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be
                        readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the
                        time of the Middle Kingdom.[85]
                        Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published
                        in 1607

                        Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[86] The
                        city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the
                        intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the
                        3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization
                        following the fall of Rome in CE 476.In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was
                        the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to
                        influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius
                        gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good
                        governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to influence
                        education in East Asia into the modern era.</p>

                    <p class="para-small">Education designed to support early development in preparation for
                        participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for children below the age of
                        three. This is ISCED level 01.[56] Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to
                        seven, depending on the country when children enter primary education. The children now readily
                        interact with their peers and the educator.[56] These are also known as nursery schools and as
                        kindergarten, except in the US, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of
                        primary education.[58] Kindergarten "provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three-
                        to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and
                        moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them.Closely related to the distinction between
                        formal and informal education is that between conscious education, which is done with a clear
                        purpose in mind, and unconscious education, which occurs on its own without being consciously
                        planned or guided.[39] This may happen in part through the personality of teachers and adults by
                        having indirect effects on the development of the student's personality."</p>

                    <p class="para-Big">Education </p>
                    <p class="para-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as
                        transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                        development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize
                        the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some
                        theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a
                        value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer,
                        not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions
                        possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from
                        one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as
                        the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational
                        skills. Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education.
                        Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by
                        curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions,
                        formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages
                        such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as
                        addition or alternative to formal education.</p>
